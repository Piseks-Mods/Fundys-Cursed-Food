# Fundy's Cursed Food

This mod adds food from one certain [Fundy's video](https://youtu.be/h9yLFPI4PbY).

As in his video, here the food is obtained by combining Steak and Cooked Porkchop and later by combining the previous tier with another item.

After reaching the final tier you can call yourself a god because you've obtained an item that can one-shot everything *(except a tamed animal. you don't want to make everybody sad)*.
